   <p> Hello, my name is Rohit Denduluri. I am in 9th grade in Emerald high school. I am a junior web developer and my goal is to
        get into a coding job. The reason this is my goal is because my parents are both coders and my parents are my inspiration, 
        so I want to be just like them. My mom works in an AI job and my dad works in Oracle. Another reason why I want to get a
         coding job is because I want to be able to make a good app that many users like in the future.

    Some characteristics I possess include being cooperative, knowledgeable, and supportive. Some of my major accomplishments include
     making an 8-ball app and being the tester for an emergency app made with other people. Other major accomplishments include 
     getting the Principals honor roll twice in middle school and also being able to bring up all my grades to A's.Currently in 
    9th grade, I am part of a vex robotics club and table tennis club with my friends. I am also taking Honors advanced English 
    and Honors chamber orchestra.

       These experiences have taught me to always work hard to achieve your goals and that the hard work you put in is always worth
       it at the end. Thank you for looking at my about me.One quote I follow is "Always strive to be the best."Enjoy looking at the other pages!
       These highschool experiences have taught me to always work hard to achieve your goals and that the hard work you put in 
       is always worth it at the end.An example of this includes me getting my algebra 2 grade up from a failing grade to an A-
        in 2 months by studying really hard for math. One quote I follow is "Dreams don't have to just be dreams. You can make it a reality; if you just keep pushing and keep trying, then eventually you'll reach your goal”
       Thank you for looking at my “about me” and enjoy looking at the other pages!
