   <!--About me page description-->
   <p> Hello, my name is Rohit Denduluri. I am a junior web developer and my goal is to get into a coding job. The reason
       this is my goal is because my parents are both coders and my parents are my inspiration, so I want to be just like them.
       Also, I wanted to try out computer science and see if this could be the path for me.
